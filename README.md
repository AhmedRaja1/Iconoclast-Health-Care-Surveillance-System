# Iconoclast-Health-Care-Surveillance-System
We proposed a 24/7 health care surveillance system through which the vital human organ activities are first sensed by the pulse and temperature wearable sensors, then this data is processed by passing through a microcontroller (Arduino UNO) and hardware high pass â€“ filters, after that the meaningful data from the microcontroller in real-time is uploaded to an online server (Thing speak IoT server) as well as a local server, the data now converts into meaningful information in the form of medical facts and figures, which can be accessed at any time from any place around the globe via the internet or local server by a medical expert/physician or doctor for diagnosis and prescription, thus eliminating the distance between a doctor and patient. An online server records the latest activity of vital organs while monitoring data accessed from the human body if any disruption occurs the system sends warning messages to alert the doctor to take some timely precautionary measures. The stored data can also be used for future predictions as a historical record of the patient.
